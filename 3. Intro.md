## Internet
- Inter-Connected Networks of billions of devices
- Network of Networks

## How client-server model works?
***Client Request(Browser) -> Domain Name(www.google.com) -> DNS-DNR -> IP Adress -> ISP(internet service provider) -> access Internet***

## Some Networking Devices
### **1️⃣ Hub**
- **Function:** A basic device that connects multiple computers in a network.
- **How It Works:** When a device sends data, the hub **broadcasts it to all connected devices**, regardless of the intended recipient.
- **Downside:** It leads to network congestion because all devices receive the same data.
- **Use Case:** Rarely used today; replaced by switches.

### **2️⃣ Switch**
- **Function:** A more intelligent version of a hub that connects multiple devices in a network.
- **How It Works:** It **forwards data only to the intended device** rather than broadcasting it to all.
- **Advantage:** Reduces traffic congestion and improves network efficiency.
- **Use Case:** Used in LAN (Local Area Networks) for efficient data transfer.

### **3️⃣ Router**
- **Function:** Connects different networks together (e.g., home network to the internet).
- **How It Works:** Routes data between networks using **IP addresses**.
- **Advantage:** Can provide **WiFi, security (firewall), and manage traffic** between different networks.
- **Use Case:** Used in homes, offices, and ISPs to connect users to the internet.

### **4️⃣ Modem**
- **Function:** Converts digital signals from a computer into an analog signal for transmission over telephone lines, and vice versa.
- **How It Works:** Connects to an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and provides **internet access**.
- **Advantage:** Essential for internet connection if using DSL or cable networks.
- **Use Case:** Used in homes and offices to connect to the internet.

### **Key Differences**
| Device  | Purpose | How It Works | Common Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Hub** | Connects multiple devices | Broadcasts data to all devices | Outdated, replaced by switches |
| **Switch** | Connects multiple devices | Sends data only to the intended recipient | LAN networks |
| **Router** | Connects different networks | Routes data between networks | Internet access, WiFi |
| **Modem** | Connects to ISP | Converts signals for internet access | Used for internet connection |


### **What is an IP Address?**  
An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, allowing it to communicate with other devices over the internet or a local network.

### **Types of IP Addresses**  
1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**  
   - Example: `192.168.1.1`  
   - Uses a **32-bit** address (4 sets of numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255).  
   - Limited number of addresses (about 4.3 billion).  

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**  
   - Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`  
   - Uses a **128-bit** address (more complex format).  
   - Created to solve IPv4 exhaustion by offering a much larger number of addresses.
