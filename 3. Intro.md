## Internet
- Inter-Connected Networks of billions of devices
- Network of Networks

## How client-server model works?
***Client Request(Browser) -> Domain Name(www.google.com) -> DNS-DNR -> IP Adress -> ISP(internet service provider) -> access Internet***

## Some Networking Devices:
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Hub**
- **Function:** A basic device that connects multiple computers in a network.
- **How It Works:** When a device sends data, the hub **broadcasts it to all connected devices**, regardless of the intended recipient.
- **Downside:** It leads to network congestion because all devices receive the same data.
- **Use Case:** Rarely used today; replaced by switches.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Switch**
- **Function:** A more intelligent version of a hub that connects multiple devices in a network.
- **How It Works:** It **forwards data only to the intended device** rather than broadcasting it to all.
- **Advantage:** Reduces traffic congestion and improves network efficiency.
- **Use Case:** Used in LAN (Local Area Networks) for efficient data transfer.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Router**
- **Function:** Connects different networks together (e.g., home network to the internet).
- **How It Works:** Routes data between networks using **IP addresses**.
- **Advantage:** Can provide **WiFi, security (firewall), and manage traffic** between different networks.
- **Use Case:** Used in homes, offices, and ISPs to connect users to the internet.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Modem**
- **Function:** Converts digital signals from a computer into an analog signal for transmission over telephone lines, and vice versa.
- **How It Works:** Connects to an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and provides **internet access**.
- **Advantage:** Essential for internet connection if using DSL or cable networks.
- **Use Case:** Used in homes and offices to connect to the internet.

### **Key Differences**
| Device  | Purpose | How It Works | Common Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Hub** | Connects multiple devices | Broadcasts data to all devices | Outdated, replaced by switches |
| **Switch** | Connects multiple devices | Sends data only to the intended recipient | LAN networks |
| **Router** | Connects different networks | Routes data between networks | Internet access, WiFi |
| **Modem** | Connects to ISP | Converts signals for internet access | Used for internet connection |


## **What is an IP Address?**  
      An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, 
      allowing it to communicate with other devices over the internet or a local network.

### **Types of IP Addresses**  
1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**  
   - Example: `192.168.1.1`  
   - Uses a **32-bit** address (4 sets of numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255).  
   - Limited number of addresses (about 4.3 billion).  

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**  
   - Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`  
   - Uses a **128-bit** address (more complex format).  
   - Created to solve IPv4 exhaustion by offering a much larger number of addresses.  

## **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**  

### **7 Layers of the OSI Model:**  
1. **Physical Layer**  
   - Deals with hardware like cables, switches, and signals.  
   - Converts digital data into electrical, radio, or optical signals.  

2. **Data Link Layer**  
   - Manages communication between devices on the same network.  
   - Uses **MAC addresses** to identify devices.  
   - **Example protocols:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11).  

3. **Network Layer**  
   - Routes data across different networks using **IP addresses**.  
   - Determines the best path for data packets.  
   - **Example protocols:** IP, ICMP (ping).  

4. **Transport Layer**  
   - Ensures data is delivered correctly and in order.  
   - Uses **TCP (reliable, ordered delivery)** and **UDP (faster, no guarantee of order)**.  

5. **Session Layer**  
   - Manages communication sessions between applications.  
   - Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.  

6. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Converts data formats for applications (e.g., encryption, compression).  
   - **Example protocols:** SSL/TLS (for secure communication).  

7. **Application Layer**  
   - Provides network services to users and applications.  
   - **Example protocols:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP(email), DNS.

## **TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)**  
### **4 Layers of TCP/IP Model**  
1. **Network Access Layer (Link Layer)**  
   - Deals with physical hardware like switches, cables, and Wi-Fi signals.  
   - Uses **MAC addresses** for device identification.  
   - **Example protocols:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP.  

2. **Internet Layer**  
   - Handles **IP addressing** and **routing** of packets between networks.  
   - Uses **routers** to find the best path for data.  
   - **Example protocols:** IP, ICMP (ping).  

3. **Transport Layer**  
   - Manages end-to-end communication between devices.  
   - Uses **TCP (reliable, ordered delivery)** and **UDP (faster, unordered delivery)**.  
   - **Example protocols:** TCP, UDP.  

4. **Application Layer**  
   - Provides network services to applications and users.  
   - Includes web browsing, email, file transfer, etc.  
   - **Example protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP(email), DNS.
