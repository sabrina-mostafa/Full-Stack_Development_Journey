The **4 basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** are:

---

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- **Definition**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.
- **Goal**: Protect data from unauthorized access or unintended modification.
- ✅ *Think*: Data hiding and controlled access.

---

### 2. **Abstraction**
- **Definition**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
- **Goal**: Reduce complexity and make the code more user-friendly.
- ✅ *Think*: "What it does," not "how it does it."

---

### 3. **Inheritance**
- **Definition**: One class (child/subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent/superclass).
- **Goal**: Reuse code and establish a parent-child relationship.
- ✅ *Think*: "Is-a" relationship (e.g., a `Car` is a `Vehicle`).

---

### 4. **Polymorphism**
- **Definition**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
- **Goal**: Allow methods to behave differently based on the object calling them.
- ✅ *Think*: "Many forms" – method overloading or overriding.
