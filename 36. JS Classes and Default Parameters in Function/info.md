- To access private data outsite of the class, we use getter and setter
  - increase encapsualtion
  - use **#** to make private
### getter
- a getter is **not a method**
- It's accessed like **a property**, not like a function.
- Even though it runs a function behind the scenes, we **don’t use parentheses ()**.
- it’s a property accessor.

### setter
- getters, setters are accessed like properties, not methods.
- there is no problem if get/set keyword is not used but it's recomended to use for better understanding of the code


### Constructor
- we use it whenever we want to :
  - initialize a non-initialized class member
  - re-initialize a class member


### Default Parameter Function
- uses default value when there is no value passed to the parameters
- if the passed value is undefined then it will show the default value instead of the **passed value: undefined**
